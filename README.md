# Experiment-3
## Aim: Study of tuple in python

## Theory:
A tuple in Python is an ordered collection of elements enclosed in parentheses ().It can store different data types and allows duplicate values.
Tuples are immutable, so their elements cannot be changed once created.They hey support indexing, which allows access to individual elements using their position. 
They also support slicing, making it possible to extract a subset of elements from the sequence. In addition, they support iteration, enabling traversal through each element one by one using loops.
Because of immutability, tuples are faster and use less memory than lists. Tuples are mainly used to store **fixed or constant data** because they are **immutable**, meaning their elements cannot
be changed after creation. This makes tuples ideal for representing data that should remain the same throughout a program’s execution, such as coordinates, configuration values, or records that must 
not be modified accidentally. Since tuples do not allow operations like adding, removing, or updating elements, they provide data integrity and help prevent unintended changes. Additionally, tuples are 
more memory-efficient and slightly faster to access than lists, making them suitable for storing constant collections of values.The length of a tuple is determined using the len() function. It returns the total 
number of elements present in the tuple.Elements of a tuple can be accessed using slicing by specifying a range of indices. Slicing allows you to retrieve a portion of the tuple without modifying the original 
tuple. The syntax follows the format tuple[start : end], where the start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive.

A list uses square brackets [] and is mutable.Lists allow insertion, deletion, and modification of elements.
Tuples can be used as dictionary keys, while lists cannot.

## Algorithm:
1. Create a tuple with multiple elements.
2. Access elements of the tuple using indexing.
3. Display selected elements of the tuple.
4. Print the complete tuple.
## Tuple Properties Program
1. Create a tuple with different values.
2. Find the length of the tuple.
3. Access elements using slicing.
4. Display the results.

## Conclusion:
Therefore we learnt the use of tuple in python as well as the difference between tuple and lists in python.
