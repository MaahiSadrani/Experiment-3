# Experiment-3
## Aim: Study of tuple in python
## Theory:
A tuple in Python is an ordered collection of elements enclosed in parentheses ().It can store different data types and allows duplicate values.
Tuples are immutable, so their elements cannot be changed once created.They support indexing, slicing, and iteration like lists.
Because of immutability, tuples are faster and use less memory than lists.Tuples are mainly used to store fixed or constant data.
A list uses square brackets [] and is mutable.Lists allow insertion, deletion, and modification of elements.
Tuples can be used as dictionary keys, while lists cannot.

## Algorithm:
1. Create a tuple with multiple elements.
2. Access elements of the tuple using indexing.
3. Display selected elements of the tuple.
4. Print the complete tuple.
## Tuple Properties Program
1. Create a tuple with different values.
2. Find the length of the tuple.
3. Access elements using slicing.
4. Display the results.

## Conclusion:
Therefore we learnt the use of tuple in python as well as the difference between tuple and lists in python.
